Wood Types: Sorbus, Seeping, Ghostly, Bloodwood  

Blocks:  
- Bloodied Dirt  
- Bloodied Grass  
- Logs
- Stripped Logs
- Saplings
- Planks
- Stairs
- Leaves
- Slabs
- Fence
- Buttons
- Pressure Plates
- Trapdoors
- Doors
- Gates
- Signs  

Biomes:  
- Ghostly Forrest
- Seeping Forrest
- Sorbus Hills
- Bloodwood Forrest  

All biomes have a mist visual effect that hinders the players vision.  
Some future biomes will have a poisonous effect if you don't wear  
an item in a bauble like slot but that's a future idea.  

Mob:  
- The Forgotten Warlock.

I'd advise looking at the 1.17.1 version of the mod to see how the biomes  
look and feel, The Forgotten Warlock spawns in both the Ghostly Forrest  
and the Bloodwood Forrest. TerraBlender is required for 1.18 and above!

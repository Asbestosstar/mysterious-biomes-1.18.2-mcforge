# Spooky-Biomes

### Ideas for future updates:
- Add some pools of blood to the Bloodied Hills biome.
- Players and mobs should be able to pass through Ghostly tree logs and leaves slowly when shifting.
- Generate small huts made out of the trees from each spooky biome.
- Mushrooms in the seeping forest biome some that grow on trees.
- Seeping armour. A set of armour that grants the user some slight effects when the full set is worn. Poison and other potion resistance, underwater breathing, fall damage resistance and knock back resistance.
- Special plants that can be used to create some potions, maybe change this to something else to give players special abilities if they find certain ones so for example a blood flower mixed with blood essence give you a vampire like effect where you can drink blood from players or mobs when you hit them, also burns you in daylight though as a side effect.

##### Apples:
- Blood apples, only edible by vampire players, heals health like blood to vampires. (Duh)
- Seeping apples, give a temporary feather falling like effect so players take no fall damage.
- Ghostly apples, give the player a temporary see through like effect, if you eat more than 5 at once you become invisible to anyone.
- Sorbus apples, not sure what to do with these just yet. might just make the leaves of the Sorbus tree drop normal apples. 

##### Biome charms:
- Blood mist essence. Can be dropped from Vampires or as a rare drop from the blood leaves. (1 in 20)
- Ghost mist essence. Can be dropped from Ghosts or as a rare drop from ghostly leaves. (1 in 15)
- Mist essence can be crafted into a charm that the user can carry that should dispel the mist of the biome a little making it habitable.

##### Biome specific mobs that only spawn in it's respective biome: (Might make that a config option.)
- Bloodied hills biome mob: Vampires. Attacks other living type mobs and only comes out at night, can transform into a bat to fly away if it's health is low. Is also quite fast and burns in sunlight.
- Ghostly Forest biome mob: Ghosts. Don't attack without reason. Will call friends nearby to help like pigmen. (May improve this in future to make them attack on a full moon) Vanish during the day or when looked at.
- Seeping Forest biome mob: Seeping Slimes. They drop the green slime like droplets that the trees seep, see seeping armour for it's uses.
